Hey there!

If you are a visitor and searching for WiFi, the kitchen is the place you are looking for! You will find a QR code on the back by the speakers that should cover your needs. And don't worry, I'll not be mad if you skip the rest of this document ;).\\
If you are or want to become a part of our floor-community: This document is for you!

First of all, Thank you for checking out our community handbook! Communication is the most important ingredient in a harmonizing community, and you have just made the first step!

Don't worry, this is not a page-long contract you need to sign with blood and sell your soul to the devil. Quite the contrary, actually! We are trying to build and maintain an open and respectful community with one primary rule:

\begin{displayquote}
    Just talk! :)
\end{displayquote}

Everyone is encouraged to speak their mind, bring new ideas, raise complaints, or just chat and have fun! Of course, in return, you are asked to have an open ear for others and respect their wishes.

Unfortunately, every community needs some place to dump all the organizational context, so this document is for that: a place to look up whom to ask, what to do, or where to go for your needs!
