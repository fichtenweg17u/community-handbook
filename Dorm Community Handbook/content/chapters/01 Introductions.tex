Hey, you made it to the chapters! Let's start by introducing ourselves, shall we?

Hi, my name is Robin and I'm \myage{} years old. I am currently in my computer science master and work as a web developer besides that. I am only partially living in TÃ¼bingen, since my hometown is closer to my office, so between the semesters I usually move there. But during the lecture time I am sure we'll run into each other at some point!

If you're looking for me, start in the kitchen ;). I love to cook for dinner and always appreciate some company, so if you're interested in joining some day, just react to my announcements in chat! Other than cooking, I love listening to epic music, I am a very passionate BeatSaber player and I have probably watched the \quotes{How to train your dragon} movies a few times too often \^{}\^{}.

Oh, and one more thing: In my bachelors I lived in a flat by myself, that's why I came here with a lot of household equipment. So if you are in need of something like a screwdriver or a vacuum, feel free to ask, maybe I can help!

I'm looking forward to meeting you!
