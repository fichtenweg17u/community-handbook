Hey, you made it to the chapters! Let's start by introducing ourselves, shall we?

Hi, my name is Robin and I'm \myage{} years old. I am currently in my computer science master and work as a web developer besides that. I am only partially living in Tübingen, since my hometown is closer to my office, so between the semesters I usually move there. But during the lecture time I am sure we'll run into each other at some point!

If you're looking for me, start in the kitchen ;). I love to cook for dinner and always appreciate some company, so if you're interested in joining some day, just react to my announcements in chat! Other than cooking, I love listening to epic music, I am a very passionate BeatSaber player and I have probably watched the \quotes{How to train your dragon} movies a few times too often \^{}\^{}.

Oh, and one more thing: In my bachelors I lived in a flat by myself, that's why I came here with a lot of household equipment. So if you are in need of something like a screwdriver or a vacuum, feel free to ask, maybe I can help!

I'm looking forward to meeting you!

Hi everyone, I’m Luke (or Lucas if you prefer), and I’m \myage{} years old! I’m currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree in English and American Studies with a minor in Computational Linguistics. I also work as a tutor, helping high school students with math and physics.  

While you can often find Robin in the kitchen, I’ll probably be there too—not cooking, but eating Robin’s latest creations. Most evenings, though, you’ll find me at the cinema. I love watching movies and binge-watching TV shows as well. If you hear about a movie being screened in Tübingen, let me know—I’d be glad to join!  

Oh, and I don’t have as much equipment as Robin, but if you need something or want a hand with anything, feel free to ask. I’m looking forward to meeting all of you and making some great memories this semester!

\section{Room U17: Silvy Kurzendorfer} \label{sec:SilvyK}

Hi I'm Silvy! I'm a German-Canadian in the second second semester of my bachelor in computer science. I'm often out and about. I frequent the gym, doing some combination of weightlifting and combat sports (if you want to join the best Brazillian Jui-Jitsu club in Tubingen, give me a call). I also enjoy coding and music-making. 

I, similarly to lucas, might not be the greatest cook in this kitchen, but I'm always happy to help out with any issues you might encounter, regardless of if they're sensitive or trivial. I particularly enjoy talking things out over a cup of tea!

Good luck and see ya Later
