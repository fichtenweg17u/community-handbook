      <p>
        Hey there, and welcome to our little dorm-community in the Fichtenweg 17 U!
      </p>
      <p>
        We are trying to be an open-minded, inclusive community whilst staying a fun group of people to engage with! 
        The kitchen is the center of our activities, where we regularily cook and eat dinner together ðŸ¥˜, listen to music, 
        play some games or just hang out.
        Sometimes we even leave the house and head for the cinema or other activities in TÃ¼bingen and around ðŸ˜‰.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are new here and want to get in touch with your new room-neighbours, you may join our WhatsApp Group 
        (you will find a QR-Code in the kitchen, back by the speakers) 
        or just say hi when we run into each other on the floor!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to know some details on how we organize ourselves or need some help surviving around here,
        you might find some answers in our "Community Handbook":

      <p class="mt-3">
        Of course, if there are still questions left or you just can't stand reading boring documents
        (although we try to keep it as fun to read as possible) feel free to ask anyone around.
        We will try our best to answer, wheter it's about running your studies, surviving in the WHO
        or just some general life advice ðŸ™ƒ.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3">
        Until then, we wish you a wonderful start in TÃ¼bingen!<br/>
        - Your roommates
